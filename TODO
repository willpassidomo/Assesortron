- override the onResume methods of the fragments which list stuff, so that they make a call to the database and get the most up to date values. problem is, adding a sitewalk, then going to active sitewalks and its not there
- fix ProjectTrades screen, not updating and storing properly, might be a problem with the database
- make new project so that after the questions, it shows the project trades screen`
