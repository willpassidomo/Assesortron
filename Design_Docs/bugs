there seems to be a problem with the data base.
	progresses are not getting noted on the site visit home screen (all say 0)...should be 1, see below

	new progress (SiteWalkthrough) has project name, but not floors..works the first time, but once you save one, it doesnt save (see above) and the floors dont show up

	OK, SO, ALL OF THE PROGREESEs are being stored under the first project!!!! for some reason, when you do "new site visit" it has the right project id, 

i think, the population of the "site visits in progree" is what is screwed up
- yep, they all have the same project id and site visit id, but there is the right number of them 

	there are duplicate projects appearing on the HomeScreen screen
