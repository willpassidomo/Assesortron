spinner on softQuestionsField doesnt always react when an item is selected

- CRASHED ON..made a finished sitewalk active again then tried to open it.

- make an overflow with open, email, etc in it for completed site visits.
   - same for complete observations

- CRASHED ON..new project, after project questions...project questions were empty




....get on netbeans, and change the server so it can accept pictures
